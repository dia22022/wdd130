        <p>I am majoring in computer science although my true passion is photography. This is my first semester. I'm rooming with some friends from high school so it's a blast at home. I'm excited to learn more about web design because it is facinating to me and I like knowing how things work and how to work them. I don't have a favorite scripture but I was reading 2 Corinthians and liked the verse 4:18 which talks about things that which aren't seen last forever. </p>
